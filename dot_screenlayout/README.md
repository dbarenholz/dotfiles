## ~/.screenlayout

These are scripts used in conjunction with [X](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg>) and [`i3`](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3>) to set specific monitor layouts.

- `laptop_closed.sh`: Output only on the HDMI port.
- `laptop_only.sh`: Output only on the integrated laptop screen.
- `laptop_open.sh`: Output on both at the same time, but not mirrored.
