# foot

[foot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Foot) is a terminal emulator.
It is the default terminal in [Sericea](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/sway/), so I figured I might as well use it.

- `foot.ini`: The configuration file.
- `README.md`: You're reading it.
- `themes`: A folder containing a port of the _Halcyon_ theme which I love.
