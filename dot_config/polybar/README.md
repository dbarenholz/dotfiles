## polybar

- [ ] Add some links when this is on git

[`polybar`](#) is an alternative to [`i3bar`](#) that (to me) is easier to modify and customize.
I have forced the Halcyon colors onto it.

### Configuration

The `polybar` configuration is a single `config.ini` file.
This configures the entire bar. For details, check the configuration itself.


### Unused

Just in case, I have saved unused configuration of modules into `unused.ini`.
It's probably not necessary.
