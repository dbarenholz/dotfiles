## ~/.config/polybar

[`polybar`](<https://github.com/polybar/polybar>) is an alternative to [`i3bar`](<https://i3wm.org/i3bar/>) that (to me) is easier to modify and customize.
As with everything else, I have forced the [Halcyon](<https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app>) colors onto it.

### Configuration

The `polybar` configuration is a single `config.ini` file.
This configures the entire bar. For details, check the configuration itself.


### Unused

Just in case, I have saved unused configuration of modules into `unused.ini`.
It's probably not necessary.
